security checks in your local and CI/CD environments.

Lava is part of the [Vulcan ecosystem][vulcan-docs] and it is built on
top of the same components that power Vulcan.
Thus, Lava continuously benefits from Vulcan improvements.
In fact, Lava is compatible with the [vulcan-checks][vulcan-checks]
catalog shipped with Vulcan.
